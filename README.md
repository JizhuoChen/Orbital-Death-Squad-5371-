Milestone1
Liu Diwen E0905370
Chen Jizhuo E0774920
Level of achievement:  Gemini

Project scope:
We intend to build an online library reservation system to optimize the student library experience and reduce the workload of administrators.

To build this website, we will use html to build the general framework of the website and then use css as a beautifying tool to render the website display. Since we cannot access the school's database, we built the website's own database to store user data. Then users can register and log in on our website. The registered users can log in on the website and book library seats by the reservation function which will be implemented in the website to avoid long waiting time. Administrators can use their account to check the usage of library seats through the backend for management purposes.

Ideation:

1.Pain point:
The library is always full of students at the end of mid-term. However, some students cannot get a seat to study because they live far away from the school. This also happens when some students that have two classes in a day and there is a gap between them, they usually want to spend time in the library, but it can be difficult to get a seat because they would find some other students who went to the library early and used their personal belongings to help other students take their seats. 


   Solution: 
We intend to set up a website that will require students and other staff users to log in with their NUS accounts to complete the booking process as well as the management work. (Since we do not have access to NUS databases, we built our own instead) Users will be able to book the seats for up to one week , but each account will be limited to a maximum of three time slots of two hours each at the same time. 

2.Pain point:
Some students may reserve a seat but fail to attend, making it difficult for other students to reserve a library seat and resulting in a waste of  resources.
  Solution: 
Cancellations can only be made up to two hours before the reserved time, and failure to attend the library during the reserved time period will result in a single penalty being recorded. If users get more than three penalties in a month, your booking privileges will be suspended for one week.

3.Pain point
Some students may suddenly want to go to the library to do homework or have a group meeting, but may be concerned about whether there are any seats left in the library. 
  Solution:
We will provide you with the number of seats left in the library and a map for reference.

4.Pain point:
Library managers have no way of quantifying the usage of the library and are unable to monitor it efficiently.
  Solution:
The user data in the database can be viewed directly through the administrator login to monitor all information in the library.



Future features:

Before milestone 2 we plan to complete: 
most of the design of the webpages;
booking of library seats by users;
cancellation of reserved seats by users and librarians;
display of the number and location of unused seats;

To be completed after milestone 2:
penalties for users who fail to attend/ cancel within 2 hours of the reserved time slot;
user using registered code to find password;
librarians make announcements on the website and manage the operation of the entire system;
refinement of every feature in the website.
